## Theory

Equivariant linear operators are our building blocks. Equivariance means a rotation of the input results in the same rotation of the output thus preserving symmetry. Applying a linear operator convolves the input with the operator's kernel. If the operator is also equivariant, then its kernel must be radially symmetric. Differential operators and Green's functions are in fact equivariant linear operators. We provide built in constructors for these common operators. By parameterizing the radial function, we can also construct custom neural equivariant operators for machine learning.
