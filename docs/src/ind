## Synopsis

ElectronicDensity.jl implements in Julia an equivariant machine learning model for predicting the 3D electronic density distribution and atomic forces of molecules and crystals. The model's rotation and translation equivariance assures symmetry preservation. 

## Electron density importance

Electron density is of central importance in quantum chemistry and materials science. It's involved in self consistent calculations in density functional theory (DFT), Hartree-Fock and other computational methods for determining key properties like energy, forces, stability and band gap of chemicals and materials. It's the physical observable that theoretically encodes full information from the electron wavefunction.

## Machine learning for electron density

Machine learning for electron density can both accelerate ab initio methods and replace them in predicting properties. Electronic structure calculations suffer from superlinear scaling, making them computational taxing for medium sized systems and prohibitive for very large systems. DFT scales as O(n^3), CCSD as O(n^7). They iteratively refine the density so a good initial density predicted by machine learning can accelerate convergence and reduce computational cost. Alternately, many properties can be directly computed from electron density including forces via electrostatic integration and consequently relaxed geometry plus phonon states. One can also estimate the energy using empirical energy density functionals.
